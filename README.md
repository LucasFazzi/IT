The first time I tried to work with Godot, this is a very old project that I still can't finish and I didn't fix it, I just moved from Godot to Godot to make it adaptable to 3.1.
There are lots of bugs, redundant scripts and bad things, but there are some great sprites and ideas. If anyone wants to use it as a base for something, feel free.
